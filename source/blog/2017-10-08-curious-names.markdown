If you're like me, you probably assume that the you you are now is the same you as you were before. Of course, some things will have changed---new city, different cells, etc---and more, probably, as the distance increases between the temporal slices of yourself that you consider. Yet, in a certain important sense, you're you and I'm me. That was true yesterday, it will likely be true tomorrow, and, so it appears, at  many other times besides. 

But maybe not. I noticed a couple of curious uses of proper names that seem to challenge the intuitive idea that there's a me or a you that *simply* provides a name with its referent, in any linguistic context in which the name occurs. This one, written [here](https://psmag.com/on-the-milo-bus-with-the-lost-boys-of-americas-new-right-629a77e87986#.tgtx20vs8) by Laurie Penny on Feb 21, 2017, has someone knowing someone before they were who they are:

> I knew Yiannopoulos before he was Yiannopoulos

And this one has someone explicitly *becoming* who they apparently weren't yet (this example modified from Rachel Maddow's remarks on her Feb 27, 2017 broadcast): 

> the vice chairman was in the KGB with Vladimir Putin, before he became Vladimir Putin

I'm not going to try to figure this out. I'll offer this homework question instead: Give a proper semantics for proper names, making reference to the examples above in your answer.


As a bonus, consider again that proper names are usually taken to denote individuals (so the denotation/semantic value of my name is me, the semantic value of your name is you, etc). Formally, this assumption amounts to the idea that names are expressions of type $e$, which means that they should not combine with expressions that want type $\langle e,t\rangle$ things, like *the* wants to combine with a noun like *cow*. When names occur where they shouldn't, as in *The Georges I know all have long hair*, it's not really a big problem; we can say that, here, names are "coerced" into the higher type. This amounts to saying that *Georges* expresses a property, e.g. the property of having the name *George*. 

That analysis will work in many cases, but not in the example below (from Bill Maher on May 9, 2016). 

> The Kim Davises of the world are like, "what about our right to take away your rights?" 

Such a case shows that the "coercion" (if that's what it is) has to be more flexible than property-coercion accounts typically suppose.  

That's so, at least, if you're like me, and you don't think every Kim Davis in the world goes by the name *Kim Davis*.
