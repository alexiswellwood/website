# Who communicates, and how?

.red[Humans] can communicate information in all sorts of ways:

   - Verbal/sign language
   - Written language
   - Body "language"
   - Facial expression
   - Emoji
   - Text message
   - Etc.

# Who communicates, and how?

Humans can communicate information in all sorts of ways:

   - .red[Verbal/sign language]
   - Written language
   - Body "language"
   - Facial expression
   - Emoji
   - Text message
   - Etc.

???

Human communication through language, what SORT of ability it is, who has it, and how they GET it. 

What's the first thing we can observe about this ability?

# "SNAKE!"

.image-80[![Big snake](images/Black-Snake-White-Background-Images.jpg)]

???

If you see something, like a gigantic snake, you can SAY something informative about what you see—THAT it's a snake.

What might you do if you heard someone shout SNAKE in a room like this?

# Vervet monkeys can do that.red[*]

.footnote[.red[*] 0:29-0:43, https://youtu.be/KRVxqCo9iW8 ]

???

This particular ability is not, so far, very special.

And you can see what they're doing, standing up on their hind legs and looking around, checking out where the snake might be. But what EVIDENCE do we have that this behavior is a consequence of this call, and not something else?

.footnote[.red[*] 0:52-1:05, https://youtu.be/KRVxqCo9iW8 ]

???

We can see that with this call, the behavior of the monkeys is different.

These monkeys are COMMUNICATING: if one sounds an alarm of a particular sort, the rest react appropriate to the danger being signaled.

### "There's a snake two feet away from you on your left side!" 

.image-80[![Big snake](images/Black-Snake-White-Background-Images.jpg)]

???

One thing that seems to differentiate human language from what the vervet monkeys are doing, is the level of SPECIFICITY to our speech. We don't just have the word "snake", we can say something about exactly where the snake is. 

But lest we think that this ability is unique in PRINCIPLE, consider---

The honeybees' waggle dance.

There is much more to the bee's dance that this clip doesn't tell you about.

# *Tanzsprache* ('Dance language').red[*]

.image-90[![Bee dances](images/vonfrisch.jpg)]

.footnote[.red[*] http://www.animalbehavioronline.com/frisch.html ]

???

The bee can choose different dances depending on the distance (up to 50 meters is the circle dance), the vigorousness of the dance indicates the RICHNESS of the food source, and so on. 

What questions might you have about this ability that the bee has?

Example: How is it acquired? Did the bee LEARN to do this dance?

Ethologist and Nobel laureate Karl von Frisch (Austrian biologist) famous work on the bee dance.

So what's special about human language, if anything? 

Much of this introductory lecture will be to give you a "feel" for this "qualitative difference" between the kinds of communications we see in the animal kingdom, and what we see with human language.

Nim Chimpsky, adopted into a human environment when he was 3 months old, learned a number of different signs that he used to communicate with his human handlers. But even his staunchest advocate — Herbert Terrace, a psychology professor at Colombia — ultimately concluded that Nim's linguistic abilities were exceeded even by three year old children.

Read "The troubled life of Nim Chimpsky", by Peter Singer: http://www.nybooks.com/blogs/nyrblog/2011/aug/18/troubled-life-nim-chimpsky/

# Mean Length of Utterance (MLU)

One way of measuring morphological development is to analyze the number of morphemes they produce, divided by the total number of utterances.

      MLU  =  Total number of morphemes
              -------------------------
              Total number of utterances

A child's MLU typically corresponds closely to their age. Roger Brown (1973) described 5 stages of language development based on this measure. 

     stage    MLU        approx. age (mos.)   
       I      1.0-2.0        12-26            
       II     2.0-2.5        27-30            
       III    2.5-3.0        31-34            
       IV     3.0-3.75       35-40            
       V      3.75-4.5       41-46            
       V+     4.5+           47+

# Is human language special? 

It has four properties, which .red[in combination] are unique in the animal kingdom: 

  1. Discreteness
  2. Grammar
  3. Productivity
  4. Displacement

???

For example, Nim likely lacked GRAMMAR and PRODUCTIVITY.

Phonology governs how we TALK, not how we spell. Phonological rules are learned when we're a kid, and no teacher taught us how to talk. 

What evidence do we have for internalized rules? The WUG test.

The "wug test" was first used by Jean Berko Gleason to illustrate that children really have internalized morphological rules. Read more: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Berko_Gleason

In fact, often what makes foreign languages SOUND foreign is that they're attempting to produce English sentences using a very different phonological system---they haven't mastered these implicit rules perfectly.

???

We don't store sentences whole, and then "look them up" when we need them. We actively assign meaning to novel sentences. And much of what makes grammar truly meaningful are the bits that we aren't used to thinking about. For instance, we can get meaning even in what is ultimately nonsense.

Obviously, if you haven't read Lewis Carroll's *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and *Through the Looking Glass*, you should do so immediately.

# Is it hard?.red[*]

### "...some cognitive scientists have described language as a psychological faculty, a mental organ, a neural system, and a computational module. But I prefer the admittedly quant term '.red[instinct]'. It conveys the idea that people know how to talk in more or less the sense that spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not invented by some unsung spider genius and does not depend on having had the right education or on having an aptitude for architecture or the construction trades. Rather, .red[spiders spin webs because they have spider brains, which give them the urge to spin and the competence to succeed]."

# Put yourself in the child's shoes

I want to give you a sense of what life is like for the child acquiring language, and quite how remarkable a feat they accomplish very early on. 

What I want you to appreciate is the complexity of FORM in their language, so I'm going to show you children acquiring Japanese, rather than English.

If you're a child at this age, you can't walk, talk, or feed yourself. You are utterly dependent on others for your survival. 

Can you guess what they're talking about? 

"Poor woman, why are you here if you can't afford it (festival), I may be poor but I don't owe anyone anything!" etc. 

At this age, you actually don't know yet exactly WHAT they're talking about. But despite all appearances, you're actually very busily trying to figure it out.

# And after that?

It's essentially just motor control. 

???

Any of us who have had experience with children knows that they sometimes make mistakes. And often, these mistakes can be informative as to how they're grammar is developing. But much of what they need to learn from the perspective of GRAMMAR seems to be in place already—They get the principles of the language.

Usually, the most salient difference between child speech and adult speech is in the precision with which the words and sentences are PRONOUNCED. This is because speaking is one of the most expert activities we will ever engage in. It requires coordinating a lot of different motor areas.

# Why bother studying language acquisition? 

Human language, and its acquisition, is surely remarkable, but what does it **do** for us to understand how it works? 


---
# What it means to be human.red[*]

### "Language is so tightly woven into human experience that .red[it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it]. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth, they will soon be exchanging words. When there is no one to talk with, people talk to themselves, to their dogs, even to their plants. In our social relations, .red[the race is not to the swift but to the verbal]—the spell-binding orator, the silver-tongued seducer, the persuasive child who wins the battle of wills against a brawnier parent. .red[Aphasia, the loss of language following brain injury, is devastating], and in severe cases family members may feel that the whole person is lost forever."

.footnote[.red[*] Steven Pinker, <i>The Language Instinct</i>, 1994]


---
# Why bother?

Not only is human language special in the animal kingdom, but it might be the very thing that **makes** us special.

Studying language acquisition teaches us more about this unique ability and how we came to have it.
