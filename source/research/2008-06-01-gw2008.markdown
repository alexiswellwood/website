Marshallese, an Oceanic language spoken on the atolls of the
Marshall Islands,
has a question particle,
*ke*, which may appear in one of a number of positions in
*yes/no* interrogatives. READMORE Interestingly, the availability of certain positions depends
upon whether the sentential context is affirmative or negative. We evaluate Willson (2005)’s remnant movem
ent analysis
of the distribution of *ke*, and formulate a novel approach to the problem where
*yes/no* interrogatives in Marshallese are built on a core cle
ft construction, and *ke*
is generated in the middlefield of the matrix clause.
