Acquiring the correct meanings of number words (e.g.,
*seven*, *forty-two*) is challenging, as such words fail to describe salient
properties of individuals or objects in their environment,  referring rather to properties of
sets
of such objects or individuals. Previous
research has revealed a critical role for language itself in how
children acquire number word meanings, however attempts to
pinpoint precisely the strong linguistic cues has proved challenging.  READMORE We  propose  a  novel  \"syntactic  bootstrapping\"  hypothesis in which categorizing a novel word as a determiner
leads to quantity-based interpretations.  The results of a word
learning task with 4 year olds indicates that this hypothesis is
on the right track.
