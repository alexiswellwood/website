Bresnan (1973) posited that *more* is uniformly analyzed as *much-er*, whether it appears
with adjectives (*more intelligent*, *redder*) or nouns (*more soup*).  On the earliest degree-semantic
analysis of such constructions, *much*
appears but is semantically inert: it serves to morphologically
mark the presence of the degree argument which is introduced by adjectives and nouns (Cresswell
1976). READMORE  I present an alternative analysis, one suggested by Cresswell himself: on this account, the
degree argument is introduced by
*much*.  I first show how the interpretation of this morpheme as
a structure-preserving mapping to the domain of degrees is motivated by data from nominal and
verbal comparatives,  and then how it extends to adjectival comparatives.  To accomplish this,  I
argue that adjectives express predicates of states, and interact with degrees only in composition with
*much*.   The  upshot is  a  theory in  which
*much*
universally  provides the  mapping  to degrees  for
comparison by
*more*, regardless of the syntactic category it combines with.
