Comparatives can invoke various dimensions for comparison, but not anything
goes: <i>more coffee</i> invokes volume or weight, but not temperature, while <i>more
coffees</i> invokes number, but not volume or weight. In general, the extant literature
assumes that the difference between <i>more coffee</i>/<i>coffees</i> reflects a morphosyntactic ambiguity of <i>more</i>, such that it spells out MUCH-ER with bare nouns, and MANY-ER with plural nouns. Semantically, MUCH introduces a variable over measure functions, with constraints, whereas MANY introduces a cardinality function. I argue for an alternative, univocal theory based on the decomposition MUCH-ER, and account for the observed patterns of constrained variability by means of a stronger condition on the selection of measure functions than has previously been proposed.
